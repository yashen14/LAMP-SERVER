Error when installing Apache 2.4 on windows - not logged in as administrator 

You may forgot to run as an administrator which is what happened to me felt the pie on my face lol.

Run cmd commands to move

cd \ - goes to your c drive 
 cd "directory" + "/" or "\" not sure but that plus the next directory will transpose you to the next location in your cmd drive.
